      My ode to the Irish coffee in a big stout. A dry Irish stout recipe thats
      been beefed up to get a high ABV, I also added a hefty amount of oats to
      get a thick creaminess (as it is well known, lactose in beer is an
      abomination). After getting an ABV of 7.9%, I added a litre of Jameson and
      'dry beaned' for 48hrs with 150g of coffee to get to my 9.7% ABV.</br></br> It's big
      on dark chocolate, coffee and vanilla flavours with a big punch at the end
      from the whiskey. One for sipping at room temp.
