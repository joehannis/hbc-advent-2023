    This is my idea of a hybrid Christmas beer. I wanted to make a British ESB,
    but use some of the techniques and additions that you would usually find in
    a Belgian Dubbel to create a great Christmas Beer. </br></br>
    It's Maris Otter and DarkCrystal, and I used First Gold Hops. All very ESB, but with a step mash.
    With 10 minutes left in the boil, I added cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger
    and bitter orange peel. I made a mistake and forgot to add molasses sugar to
    the boil, so decided to risk it and put it in the fermenter, considerably
    upping the ABV. I fermented hot to deliberately bring out the fruity esters.</br></br>
    The beer is a winter warmer, with a spicy, dark fruits aroma and a dark,
    sticky molasses and caramel flavour.
